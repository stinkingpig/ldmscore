/* This example reports usage info by Product.
   It also includes some useful ways to filter the results (but they are commented out for now):
   	** the 1st WHERE will limit the results to Custom Products (those you created).
   	** the 2nd WHERE will limit the results to ONLY those Products which are installed on at least 1 PC.
   	** the 3rd WHERE will limit the results to Products in Compliance Groups (all Compliance Groups).
   	** the 4th WHERE will limit the results to Products in a specific Compliance Group named "All Products".
   		NOTE:	You could use All Products to report specific products that you want to track.
   			You have to create a Compliance Group called All Products, and add some Products to it.
   To use these examples, just remove the beginning and ending slash/asterisk.
   To use more than one example (or multiple examples), change all but the first "WHERE" to "AND" (just the outermost WHEREs).
